            <p>
                I am Brittany Mueller, a 5th year Computer Science Co-op student, minoring in Mathematics. 
                This report will go over the skills I developed and goals I achieved over my 8 month co-op term at Tulip.

            <h2>About Tulip</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>Job Description & Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As a Software Developer on the Checkout team, one of Tulip's product development teams, my main responsibilities included 
                investigating, designing, and implementing features and bug fixes for our application. I was also responsible for 
                creating test plans for the QA team to provide the context needed for thorough testing. The software development process
                we employed involved changes first undergoing code review, followed by validation from QA to ensure desired functionality.
                As a member of the Checkout team, I also contributed to our agile processes by attending a daily scrum, pair-programming
                and discussing implementation with other developers as necessary, and participating in retros and demos during our sprint review.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my work term, I worked primarily as a backend developer on a number of APIs used by our applications and clients.
                The two main programming languages I used for this were Golang and PHP.  This was a new learning experience for me as I had
                previously never used either of those languages.  With all the APIs our team maintained, I was also provided the opportunity
                to learn to contribute to and work with existing code bases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another occasional responsibility as a Software Developer was being assigned to work on Checkout service requests. 
                This process, which we referred to as Interrupts, involved one person being ___ to handle incoming service requests by asking and responding
                to questions, investigating, and triaging tickets accordingly.  This process provided me the opportunity to test my depth of understanding
                of our systems and learn how to approach this style of work.
            </p>

            <h2>Learning Goals & Reflections</h2>
            <h4><i>Develop Skills in PHP</i></h4>
            <p>
                The largest of our APIs at Tulip are written in PHP, so naturally becoming not only familiar with but confident in working with PHP was a goal of mine.
                I aimed to pick up backend tickets working with this API whenever possible to gain exposure whenever possible.  
                I also used the code review process on merge requests as an opportunity to learn PHP best practices and adopt those standards.
                Ultimately I was able to develop a much deeper understanding of our backend systems and the MVC project structure our main API uses and now feel very confident working in PHP.
            </p>
            <h4><i>Develop Skills working with MySQL</i></h4>
            <p>
                This was my first experience working with a large database, so a goal of mine was to become comfortable with and develop skills working with MySQL databases.
                I did so by picking up backend tickets involving changes to tables or queries whenever possible.  I also learned to use 
                the database effectively when working on our endpoints. Overall, I feel I achieved this goal and now feel confident working with MySQL and writing queries.
            </p>
            <h4><i>Improve Backend Debugging Skills</i></h4>
            <p>
                As an aspiring backend developer, I was very eager to finally be doing exactly that!  However, with only existing frontend experience
                where it tends to be visually apparent what an issue is, I felt very in the dark when it came to how to approach troubleshooting in the backend. 
                A goal of mine was to fix this and learn how to effectively debug backend. The first way I set out to do this was by setting up a debugger in my PHP environment, 
                learning how to effectively use breakpoints and step through code to pinpoint problems. In addition to the debugger, I learned how to use Postman to make requests directly to our API 
                and then view how the system responds through the Docker logs. By the end of my term, I was able to share my knowledge with team members to help problem solve, discuss implementation or functionality, and generally diagnose issues. 
                Debugging is a very integral part of development, and I feel I greatly achieved this goal.  I now feel very confident in my backend development skills.
            </p>
            <h4><i>Participate in Code Reviews</i></h4>
            <p>
                A major component of our team's software development process was code reviews, so it became a goal of mine to
                learn how to participate in the code review process. By reviewing feedback on incoming merge requests, I was able to
                learn best practices and standards to follow, resulting in less iterations on my own merge requests.
                Overall, I achieved this goal in the sense I was able to improve the quality of my code, but feel I could have
                left suggestions on others merge requests more often.
            </p>
            <h4><i>Develop Skills with Service Request Tickets</i></h4>
            <p>
                Another goal I feel I met was around working on "Interrupts" with service request tickets.  
                Learning how to investigate and triage service requests effectively is an important skill set I wanted to learn during my time at Tulip.
                I feel I took the initiative and ultimately pushed myself outside of my comfort zone so I could gain this experience.
                I still have a lot to learn, but have gained confidence in how to approach interrupt style tickets on my own so feel I achieved this goal.
            </p>
            <h4><i>Improve Participation in Team Discussions</i></h4>
            <p>
                The last goal I achieved was to do with improving my team participation (demos, retros, discussions, team goals). 
                One way I did this was by organizing and giving my own tech talk to both of the Checkout teams.  
                This was definitely something again outside of my comfort zone, but it gave me an opportunity to knowledge share across teams.  
                I made an effort to shadow discussions beyond me whenever possible just to gain that exposure and ultimately learn how to participate myself.
                I volunteered to create demo slides or demo sprint work whenever possible. Overall, I aimed to be more involved in our greater team processes, 
                which can feel difficult as a co-op, but I think I was able to achieve this.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Overall, my 8 month work term at Tulip was very successful.  I had suspected for quite awhile that backend was the type 
                of work I wished to pursue and this co-op really solidified that for me. I also discovered that I much prefer the smaller company feel.
                It really felt like my contributions were meaningful and it was rewarding to see my development work come to life in our application.
                I also had the opportunity to learn many new technologies and strengthen my skills with those I was already familiar with:

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to thank Tulip and especially all of my team members on the CobraChicken team for making this a truly amazing co-op term.
                I was constantly encouraged to keep learning and trying new things and from that I was able to really grow as a developer.
