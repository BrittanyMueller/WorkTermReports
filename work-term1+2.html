            <p>
                I am Brittany Mueller, at the time of writing this, I'm a 3rd year Computer Science Co-op student,
                minoring in Mathematics. This report will go over my 8 month co-op term (May to Dec 2020) at The Co-operators,
                what I accomplished, the skills I developed, and how I was able to find success despite a fully remote work environment.

            <h2>About the Co-operators</h2>
            <p>
                The Co-operators is a Canadian insurance co-operative founded in Saskatchewan in 1945.
                Their head office is located here in downtown Guelph, which is where I would have been working had my work term not been remote.
                The Co-operators consists of several subsidiary companies that each provide different solutions.
                The largest of these companies, is Co-operators General Insurance Company, which offers property and casualty
                (P&C) insurance (home, auto, farm, & commercial) through a network of advisors across Canada.

            <h2>Job Description & Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                My role as a Junior Developer & System Analyst started on the SPM Compensation team.  SPM (Sales Performance Management),
                our teams overall project, is a web application for Co-operators advisors to
                manage their agency, staff, and sales commissions.  My main responsibilities included developing, deploying,
                and maintaining multiple test automation suites that supported regression testing of this application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Test suite development was done using Robot Framework (a keyword-driven test automation framework), web drivers, and Selenium keyword libraries for web testing.
                Test case writing involved first finding locators for key HTML elements, or using XPath to query the HTML if unique identifiers didn't exist, then
                using Selenium keywords with these locators to automate navigation of the web browser.

                Deployment was done using Jenkins, a CI/CD automation server, where I created and managed Jenkins pipeline jobs for each test suite through a Jenkinsfile.
                To compliment these Jenkins builds, particularly the daily health check that runs each morning, I created a custom email template in Groovy and HTML
                that parses the log files after each scheduled build into a concise fail/pass summary and sends the results.

                I was also responsible for developing and maintaining an assortment of macro enabled templates for comparing and validating files, which required me to learn VBA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Going into this co-op, I had no prior experience with any of these technologies, but my knowledge of
                HTML and JavaScript made learning web testing with Robot Framework and debugging easier to approach.  My previous experience
                with Python was also an asset when creating custom libraries for the testing of SPM's Commissions dashboards.
                Overall, as the sole developer on these test suites in a COVID-19 remote setting, my ability to work independently, pick up and self-teach new
                technologies as needed, and my strong analytical skills were all vital to my success.

            <h2>Learning Goals & Reflections</h2>
            <h4> <i>Improve Documentation and Organization Skills</i></h4>
            <p>
                When I started, one of my struggles was around understanding where to pick up on our old test automation suite since no documentation existed for it.
                As this was my first time working in a corporate environment, documenting work through Jira tasks and Confluence was new to me
                so it became a goal of mine to fill the gaps in our documentation and improve my own organization skills in the process.
                I succeeded at this by creating detailed Jira tickets and Confluence pages so my supervisors could track my work.
                I created Confluence pages for each of my test suites where I outlined their purpose, test coverage, and provided relevant links to their Bitbucket repos and Jenkins jobs.
                I also documented setup and accesses required for the Robot development environment. I often had team members
                or coworkers from other teams reach out to me because they were interested in my work or wanted to learn more about Robot Framework,
                and they found this documentation quite helpful.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4><i>Develop Skills in Robot Framework Test Automation</i></h4>
            <p>
                My first major project at The Co-operators was developing an enhanced daily health check for SPM.
                The existing health check was undocumented, not very robust, and written in Java.  At this point I had never
                done any test automation before, so starting from scratch was most efficient. I chose to start over in Robot Framework,
                a technology being used by another team who could provide some initial setup and technical support if needed.
                I began teaching myself Robot Framework and created a new daily health check with significantly more test coverage than before.

                As my skills with Robot grew, I expanded the scope of our regression testing from just a health check into
                testing full Workflows such as onboarding new agency staff, offboarding staff, and requesting e-signed documents.

                Towards the end of my term, I took my experience from the daily health check and created a similar test suite
                for my digital team.

                Of all my goals, this is the one I am most proud of and feel I found the most success with.  I feel confident
                in the test automation skills I've developed and my knowledge of Robot Framework.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4> <i>Build Confidence Speaking to Large Groups</i></h4>
            <p>
                Presenting or speaking to groups has never been my strong suit, so I wanted a goal of mine to be building my confidence speaking to larger groups, especially senior members.
                One thing I did to help achieve this was occasionally offering to lead the daily stand up on my digital team. This helped me
                practice speaking in a structured setting. Besides this, the key to my success was learning to take ownership of my project work.
                Test automation in particular was something I could own and something only I could speak to, which helped me develop that confidence and recognize just how valuable my work was.
                Ultimately, I was able to extend the confidence I felt in my work to my presentations, and successfully
                gave demos of my regression test suites to both the greater SPM team and senior leadership team.

            <h4> <i>Develop Front-End Dev Skills</i></h4>
            <p>
                Towards the end of my second term, I was given the unique opportunity to extend the scope of my work from SPM
                into front end development for a digital team, Ctrl Alt Elite. I worked on enhancements to their Data Generator Tool,
                an Angular web app used to automate the creation of test clients and policies.
                My major contribution to the tool was adding a Changelog page to address major releases and an About
                page to make the tool more user friendly. Through this work I was able to develop new front-end skills and a deeper understanding
                of Angular projects. Overall, this is one goal I feel I could have been more successful with.
                I felt there was still so much I had to learn, but unfortunately my work term came to an end! Regardless,
                this experience certainly helped me realize web development is something I'd love to try more of.

            <h4> <i>Mentor New Developer on Robot Framework</i></h4>
            <p>
                Mid October, a new junior developer started on the SPM team. One of my goals before the end of my term
                was to help him ramp up to ensure all my test suites and Jenkins jobs could seamlessly live on and be maintained after I was gone.
                To accomplish this, I took on more of a mentorship role and began sharing my experiences with Robot Framework and Jenkins,
                as well as collaborating on project work with him. I prepared additional documentation as a tips and troubleshooting guide
                for him to follow.  As his skill with Robot grew, I continued to delegate work and provide ad hoc support.
                By the end of my term, he was managing the test suites on his own and, based on feedback from my supervisors,
                is confident in his ability to troubleshoot and maintain the suites!

            <h4> <i>Learn to work in an Agile Environment</i></h4>
            <p>
                My SPM team used a Kanban board to organize work and held daily stand ups where we'd give updates about what we did yesterday, what we plan to do today, and raise any blockers we might have.
                Over the course of my work term, I participated in an array of agile ceremonies.  Each of my teams held a daily stand up each morning where we gave updates and raised any blockers we might have.
                On my digital team, I occasionally took on leading these stand ups.


                I demonstrated my successes by

                During my term, I was also given the opportunity to receive my LEAN White Belt Certification.
                LEAN is a methodology that aims to eliminate waste (poor design, poor communication, etc.) and optimize
                that the Agile methods development -- optimally the two methods should be used, "LEAN methods help
