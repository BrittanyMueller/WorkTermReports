            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                My role as a Junior Developer & System Analyst started on the SPM Compensation team, a small team within IT Solutions & Delivery .
                SPM (Sales Performance Management), our teams overall project, is a web application for Co-operators advisors to
                manage their agency, staff, and sales commissions.  The SPM compensation team is primarily responsible for managing the commissions section of the application.
                As the only developer it was weird

                My main responsibilities included developing, deploying, and maintaining multiple test automation suites.
                I also did VBA templates but where do i fit this in...
                Going into this co-op, I had some basic experience with HTML and JavaScript which but had no experience with test automation.
                , but found through test automation,
                in which I wasn't directly I was able to strengthen those skills.When I first started, we had one test suite that was no longer being maintainedin which I was responsible
                for developing and  test automation for the SPM application.  I also created and managed a
                skills required
                -
                Self teaching
                I encountered many new technologies
                in a remote environment so a lot of experience was self taught, learned a lot on the job on my own,
                required being able to work independently
                created managed jenkins build
                test automation - html/css and javascript knowledge to understand
                required strong analytical skills, in order to
                vba templates
                My team, the Sales Performance Management (SPM) Within this company lives the team(s) I worked with during my time at Co-operators
            <p>
                talk about how it was remote, how it was unique experience opportunity of working on two different teams.
                During the second half of my time with Co-operators, I was given the unique opportunity of working for a different team.

                consisted of mainly QAs and business analysts.
                to ensure quality in a website :S
                SPM (Sales Performance Management) is an application for advisors to manage their agency, staff, and sales under cooperators, so the SPM compensation team was primarily responsible for managing the commissions section of the application.
                As the only developer it was weird
                Essentially our team was responsible for managing the SPM
                When I started, the need for regression testing of SPM was apparent. a common goal was developing a regression there was an apparent need for testing

                During the second term I was given the unique opportunity to work with another team whose focus was
                Client Experience

            <h2>Goals - S20</h2>
            <p>
                1. Improve documentation and organization skills
                jira tickets to document progress on work

                As this was my first time working in a corporate environment, the process of documenting work through Jira
                tasks and Confluence

                2. Develop skills in robot framework
                talk about the projects i worked on, talk about success, results of automation
                talk about jenkins,talk about groovy email script to display robot results
                3. gain confidence when speaking to large groups/senior members
                in a remote environment, it was especially daunting navigating even day to day correspondance,
                most times having a chat or asking someone for advice felt like it required emails or meetings
                (this is getting off topic tho, but i thought i could use it as a lead up to stress my lack of confidence)
                success - were able to successfully present our project work, regression testing project

                that the Agile methods development -- optimally the two methods should be used, "LEAN methods help

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m especially grateful that I got this really unique opportunity of being able to work on two
                different teams, I started on AX for the SPM compensation team for most of my term and then now
                being over here seeing the CX side of things, it helps complete the picture and is interesting
                to see both sides of it.
